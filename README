Ever organised a ThinkGeek group order and felt like pulling your hair
out when calculating how much everyone owed for the order + shipping
and then the order actually arrives and you have to do it all over
again for the amazingly high Customs charges?

Well, this script should help out a bit, so you have more time to
enjoy your goodies and growl at Customs people.

To check all is in order:

   ./test_tg-order.pl

To go for a test run:

   ./tg-order.pl samples/sampleA-email

The format is based on the list in the email ThinkGeek sends you when
dispatching your order.

There's kind of no error checking... yet.
